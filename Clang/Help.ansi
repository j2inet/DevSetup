                    [34mCLANG Build Script[0m

  This repository contains scripts for [35mpartially[0m automating the process of 
  building Clang. There are some assumptions that are made about your 
  environment.

  1. That you have Visual Studio Community installed in the typical location    
  2. That you have Git in your path. 


                     [35mRunning the Script[0m

Before running the scripts, you may want to edit the file installation 
variables. The are in [35mCLangDefineEnvironmentVariables.cmd[0m. The variables
include the temporary folder that will used for downloading the installations
and the source URLs for the installations of Python and CMake, among a few 
other settings. 

Once you have reviewed and modified this file, begin by running the scripts
[34mPart1.cmd[0m. This script will invoke an update to Visual studio to 
ensure that it has the components that it needs and installing Python3. If you
already have these items installed, you can skip these steps. 

Next, close the command prompt in which you ran this script and open a new one.
The new prompt will have environment variables that were set by the 
installations. Run the script [32mPart2.cmd[0m.

At this time, feel free to go out for lunch. This part is going to run for a 
while. No further interaction should ne necessary. When this script completes,
you should have a locally build copy of Clang.

  You may want to ensure that your computer doesn't go to sleep.
